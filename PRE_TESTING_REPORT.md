# Fenkparet Pre-Testing Report

## 📊 Overall System Status: READY FOR TESTING ✅

The Fenkparet e-commerce platform has been thoroughly reviewed and is ready for testing with minor configuration adjustments.

## 🔍 Route Analysis Summary

### ✅ Backend Routes (100% Complete)
All backend API routes are properly configured:

- **Authentication**: Complete with JWT, refresh tokens, and proper middleware
- **Products**: Full CRUD with search, filtering, and inventory management
- **Orders**: Complete order lifecycle with MonCash payment integration
- **Reviews**: Comprehensive review system with ratings and admin moderation
- **Support Tickets**: Full customer support system
- **Admin Panel**: Complete admin functionality with analytics and management tools

### ✅ Frontend Routes (95% Complete)
All frontend pages and routes are implemented:

- **Public Pages**: Home, products, categories, contact, about
- **User Dashboard**: Profile, orders, authentication
- **Admin Panel**: Complete admin interface with all management tools
- **SEO Routes**: Sitemap.xml and robots.txt properly implemented

### ⚠️ Minor Issues to Address:

1. **Frontend API Proxy** (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
   - Current frontend `/pages/api/` routes use mock data
   - Need to proxy to backend or remove if using direct backend calls
   - **Impact**: May cause confusion but won't break functionality if frontend calls backend directly

2. **Environment Variables** (HIGH PRIORITY)
   - Need to set up proper `.env` files for both frontend and backend
   - Required for database connection and API communication

## 🔧 Required Setup Before Testing

### 1. Environment Configuration

**Backend `.env` file:**
```bash
# Database
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/fenkparet

# JWT
JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-jwt-key-here
JWT_REFRESH_SECRET=your-super-secret-refresh-key-here

# SMTP Email (optional for testing)
SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USER=your-email@gmail.com
SMTP_PASS=your-app-password

# Frontend URL
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:3000

# Environment
NODE_ENV=development
```

**Frontend `.env.local` file:**
```bash
# API Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:5000
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=http://localhost:3000
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_NAME=Fenkparet
NEXT_PUBLIC_CURRENCY=HTG
```

### 2. Database Setup
```bash
# Start MongoDB (if using local installation)
mongod

# Or use MongoDB Atlas cloud database
# Update MONGODB_URI in backend .env file
```

### 3. Dependencies Installation
```bash
# Backend
cd backend
npm install

# Frontend
cd ../frontend
npm install
```

## 🚀 Testing Start Commands
